This repository serves as my personal library of **C#, algorithm, and OOP examples**.
It documents my journey in mastering **C# and .NET technologies**, featuring clean code practices and logical problem-solving.

## Repository Structure
Since these are standalone console applications:
* Each `.cs` file represents a unique algorithm or project.
* You can run them individually without complex project setups.
